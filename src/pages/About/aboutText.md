## About Me

<!-- ![me](/src/images/me_main.jpeg "Me") -->
I am **Mike Lloyd** and I created this page to tell a bit about myself and to showcase some of the projects I've done and I'm still working on.

I am a Christian, husband, father, bass guitarist, engineer, developer, and home improver. I have many interests but in everything I do, I seek to do it to the best of my ability.

### Mechanical Engineering
Professionally, I am a mechanical engineer working in the aerospace industry. My focus is on bearings and fasteners but I have picked up experiece in many areas as part of this focus.

This includes mechanical engineering concepts like:
- Machine design
- Motion control
- Hydraulic, pneumatic, and electro-magnetic actuation
- Control systems (PID, PLC, ladder logic)
- Finite Element Analysis
- Design Optimization

Materials science:
- Metallurgy
- Heat treatement
- Hydrogen embrittlement failures

### Computer Science and Web Development
I have been studying computer science since college where I was first introduced to C++. But even when I was a kid, I developed small automation subroutines using Applescript. It's always been something I've been interested in. It wasn't until I began my professional career that I started studying computer science more seriously.

Some of the software skillsets I've learned:
- Javascript/HTML/CSS/jQuery
- React/React Native (this site is built on React)
- Python (with Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib)
- Labview
- VBA

### US Marine Corps
In 2007, I joined the US Marines. I signed enlistment papers for four years as an 0311 infantry rifleman. Due to some tomfoolery by my recruiter, I ended up with a five year enlistment and a secondary MOS. After completing boot camp and School of Infantry in southern California, I ended up in Virginia where I trained with Marine Security Forces Battalion. I was assigned to 2nd Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team (FAST) Company in Yorktown, VA and served out my entire enlistment there. 

I trained in a wide array of skillsets with 2nd FAST Co. including combined arms employment, Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT), Advanced Urban Combat, Close Quarters Battle (CQB), Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS), helicopter operations, fixed site security, small-unit tactics, and a slew of other 3 - 4 letter acronymns.

I spent most of my time in the Marines in some kind of leadership position. I was placed as a team leader as a PFC and eventually bumped up to a squad leader as a lance corporal. I was meritoriously promoted to corporal before I had reach 2 years of time in service and finally reached the rank of sergeant before getting out in 2012.

### Woodworking
Finally, a hobby that I enjoy in my spare time is woodworking. I've tried my hand at cabinetry, furniture, shelving, and even musical instrument making. It's a fun hobby and it saves a lot of money by building stuff myself. Some examples can be seen in the projects section. Hopefully at some point this year, I'll be able to build a workshop in the backyard.
