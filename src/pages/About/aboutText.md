<!-- ![me](/src/images/me_main.jpeg "Me") -->
I am **Mike Lloyd** and I created this page to tell a bit about myself and to showcase some of the projects I've done and I'm still working on.

I am a Christian, husband, father, bass guitarist, engineer, developer, and home improver. I have many interests but in everything I do, I seek to do it to the best of my ability.

Professionally, I am a mechanical engineer working in the aerospace industry. My focus is on bearings and fasteners but I have picked up experiece in many areas as part of this focus.

This includes mechanical engineering concepts like:
- Machine design
- Motion control
- Hydraulic, pneumatic, and electro-magnetic actuation
- Control systems (PID, PLC, ladder logic)
- Finite Element Analysis
- Design Optimization

Materials science:
- Metallurgy
- Heat treatement
- Hydrogen embrittlement failures

### Computer Science and Web Development
I have been studying computer science since college where I was first introduced to C++. But even when I was a kid, I developed small automation subroutines using Applescript. It's always been something I've been interested in. It wasn't until I began my professional career that I started studying computer science more seriously.

Some of the software skillsets I've learned:
- Javascript/HTML/CSS/jQuery
- React/React Native (this site is built on React)
- Python (with Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib)
- Labview
- VBA
